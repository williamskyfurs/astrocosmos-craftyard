## FAQ

- If your schematic pasted uncomplete, and there's warning:
    > "Schematic had 0000 fatal errors

    Then, you may need to acces the world folder and find the VMod config folder located in /serverconfig. In the config file, you will find:
    ```
    [VModConfig.Schematics]
	#No Comment
	#Range: > 0
	TIMEOUT_TIME = 250
    ```
    Change the TIMEOUT_TIME value, while the value must be greater than zero.
