If your game is running a little slow with VS installed, you have a few options to optimize it, here is a list compiled by <@173254529079312384- 
Note - some of these are fabric exclusive, but DO function with Sinytra Connector just fine. Others are 1.21.x exclusive, or will
not work with Create 5 or Create 6. Always read mod pages for instructions on use, most are very simple.

DH note: DH works best on systems with spare RAM (16GB+), as it exchanges increased RAM usage for optimized CPU/GPU usage rates.
You can use it as intended with 64-128 chunk render, or you can use it with standard MC chunk range for extreme performance boost.
