## Proof of VS Addition
Basically this version of VS Addition is not published in Modrinth or Curseforge, so the only way and link to download it thru Valkyrien Skies Discord server in the VS Addition Channel. Altho the person who answer in the picture down here is not the VS Addition Project Owner (which is xiewuzhiying), but the person have that VS Creators Tag

Proof of Origin: VS Addition Channel in VS Discord Server

## Proof of VS Orbit
I dont have the exact proof for this mod, since they just updated the project on Modrinth so now it can be formaly and officialy be downloaded from it. Therefore, and based on what i understand from Modrinth's guide on obtaining modpack permissions whichh is:
> Why? When uploading content to Modrinth, authors grant Modrinth the right to allow Modrinth users to use that file in Modrinth modpacks.

I should not obligated to provide the proof then

## Proof of Celestial Space
Its a merged resource pack from two packs. But because i forgot the two original resource pack maker and owner, i decided to not include it first in the modpack. ill update the modpack then

## Proof of Complementary Cosmic Patch
The patcher is still uncertain about the patched shader permission, therefore i decided to not include it first in the modpack, ill update the modpack
